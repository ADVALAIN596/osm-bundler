Python script helper to launch CMVS and PMVS2 software on Bundler result files.
Allow to compute a dense point cloud on a series of cluster.
Using CMVS could accelerate the reconstruction :
 - It make cluster that split the large scene into smaller group.
 - Each group could be computed as a dense point cloud by using PMVS2.
 - Each cluster will use lower memory and could be processed in parallel

--bundlerOutputPath=<path to the result of osm-bundler>
	The only obligatory option
--help
	Print help and exit
